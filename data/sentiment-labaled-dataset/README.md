### Description
Random sample of 1,030 tweets drawn from the COpres14 set. Tweets were labeled by 234 different volunteers, each of whom labeled 10 tweets. Specifically, a tweet was labeled as either positive, negative, or neutral, by two volunteers. If there was no agreement among volunteers regarding the polarity label of a tweet, a third independent volunteer was heard.

### Files
1. **dataset.tsv** (tab-separated values): the i-th row in the file corresponds to the unique identifier for the i-th tweet and the polarity label assigned (i.e., POS for positive, NEG for negative, and NEU for neutral).

### Features
1. id_str: "the string representation of the unique identifier for the tweet."
2. polarity label.
