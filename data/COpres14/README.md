### Description
Dataset collected during the course of the Colombia 2014 presidential election, in a two-month period from April 30, 2014 to June 24, 2014, by using Twitter Search API. A set of criteria was defined to filter tweets referring to the electoral race. Thus, only tweets containing at least one keyword or hashtag related to the presidential election (i.e., _elecciones_, _presidenciales_, _#Elecciones2014_, _#ColombiaElige_, and _#ColombiaDecide_) and full name or user mention that identifies a given candidate, were collected.

### Files
1. **dataset.dat**: the i-th row in the file corresponds to the *id_str* field (i.e., the unique identifier) for the i-th tweet.

### Features
1. id_str: "the string representation of the unique identifier for the tweet."
